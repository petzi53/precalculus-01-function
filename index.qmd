This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises of Abramson, J. (2021). [Precalculus 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus-2e) (2nd ed.). OpenStax College. 

I am not going to use the OpenStax highlight feature but [my Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/users/petzi) collecting all notes in my private ["Math" group](https://hypothes.is/groups/yVpopDka/math).
