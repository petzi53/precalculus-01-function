#### This is work in progress: Finished until p.34 of 162 pages for chapter "Function".

This Quarto book collects my personal notes, trials and exercises for the first chapter "Function" of Abramson, J. (2021). [Precalculus 2e](https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus-2e) (2nd ed.). OpenStax College. 

I am not going to use the OpenStax highlight feature but [my Hypothes.is account](https://hypothes.is/users/petzi) collecting all notes in my private ["Math" group](https://hypothes.is/groups/yVpopDka/math).

Because of the huge amount of material I am planning a separate Quarto book for each of the 12 chapters. (So the plan: I am not sure if I will ever finish this monster project.)
