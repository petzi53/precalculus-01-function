## Determining Whether a Relation Represents a Function

::: {#def-relation-domain-range}
##### Relation - domain - range

> "A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs. The set of the first
> components of each ordered pair is called the **domain** and the set
> of the second components of each ordered pair is called the
> **range.**" ([Abramson, 2021, p.
> 18](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG))

::: {#def-function}
##### Function

"A function is a relation in which each possible input value leads to
exactly one output value. We say 'the output is a function of the
input.' The input values make up the domain, and the output values make
up the range." ([Abramson, 2021, p.
18](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG))
([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=18&annotation=6PJT7CNS))
:::

::: callout-important
**Given a relationship between two quantities, determine whether the
relationship is a function.**

1.  Identify the input values.
2.  Identify the output values.
3.  If each input value leads to only one output value, classify the
    relationship as a function. If any input value leads to two or more
    outputs, do not classify the relationship as a function.
:::

::: {#exm-pricelist}
Are price lists examples of functions?

-   Each item has its price, so the price is a function of its items.
    This is even valid if several items have the same price because
    there is for each item exactly one price.
-   Several items have the same price, that's why item is not a function
    of price.
:::

### Using Function Notation

::: {#def-function-notation}
##### Function Notation: Input value - independent variable & Output value - dependent variable

> "The notation $y = f(x)$ defines a function named $f$, This is read as
> 'y is a function of x'. The letter $x$ represents the input value, or
> independent variable. The letter $y$ or $f(x)$ represents the output
> value, or dependent variable." ([Abramson, 2021, p.
> 21](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG))
> ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=21&annotation=XWZMACMS))
:::

### Representing Functions Using Tables

> "A common method of representing functions is in the form of a table.
> The table rows or columns display the corresponding input and output
> values." ([Abramson, 2021, p.
> 22](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG))

### Evaluating Functions Expressed in Formulas

::: callout-important
**Given a function in equation form, write its algebraic formula**

> "Some functions are defined by mathematical rules or procedures
> expressed in equation form. If it is possible to express the function
> output with a formula involving the input quantity, then we can define
> a function in algebraic form." ([Abramson, 2021, p.
> 26](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG))
> ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=26&annotation=4WB76Q72))

1.  Solve the equation to isolate the output variable on one side of the
    equal sign, with the other side as an expression that involves only
    the input variable.
2.  Use all the usual algebraic methods for solving equations, such as
    adding or subtracting the same quantity to or from both sides, or
    multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by the same
    quantity. ([Abramson, 2021, p.

y^2 = 1 - x^2 \\
y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
\end{align*}
$$

::::
:::::

::: {.callout-warning}
My solution is wrong as it would mean that $y = f(x)$ could be represented as function! I did not take into account that there are **two solutions**: $y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}$. We get for $y$ two outputs; the formula is therefore not a function.

y = \frac{\sqrt[3]{x}}{8}\\
y = f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt[3]{x}

### Evaluating a Function Given in Tabular Form

> ‚ÄúAs we saw above, we can represent functions in tables. Conversely, we can use information in tables to write functions, and we can evaluate functions using the tables.‚Äù ([Abramson, 2021, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=27&annotation=ZJ3WDDHY))

A one-to-one function is a function in which each output value corresponds to exactly one input value.

:::
::::{.my-example-container}
Is the area of a circle a function of its radius? If yes, is the function one-to-one?

The area = $\pi \times r^2$. $\pi$ is a constant, so yes: The area of a circle is a function of its radius. Yes, it is a `r glossary("one-to-one function")`.
::::
:::::

::: {.callout-warning}
The book answer is more elaborate: It is important to say that both values of the function $f(r) = \sqrt\frac{{A}}{{\pi}}$ are positive numbers, so that there is only one solution!

:::::

::: {.callout-warning}
My answer was correct, but in the future I should always add the reason for my solution: For example in this case:

(a) **yes**, because each bank account has a single balance at any given time
(b) **no**, because several bank account numbers may have the same balance
(c) **no**, because the same output may correspond to more than one input

## Using the Vertical Line Test

> ‚ÄúThe **vertical line test** can be used to determine whether a graph represents a function. If we can draw any vertical line that intersects a graph more than once, then the graph does *not* define a function because a function has only one output value for each input value.‚Äù ([Abramson, 2021, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=32&annotation=R9WLIZBA))

::: {.callout-important}
Given a graph, use the vertical line test to determine if the graph represents a function.

1. Inspect the graph to see if any vertical line drawn would intersect the curve more than once.
2. If there is any such line, determine that the graph does not represent a function.
:::

![Vertical line test: Whenever a vertical line crosses the curve more than once than it is *not* a function. Only the left graph is a function.](img/01-fig-11.png){#fig-01-11 
fig-alt="Three different functions: Left: a S-curve around the x-axis representing a function, because a vertical line cannot not cross two points of the curve: Middle and right: Half an O open to thre right and an ellipse do not represent a function, because a vertical line intersect two different points of the curves." fig-align="center"

width="100%"}

**Solution**: (a) and (b) are functions. (c) is not a function, because a vertical line would cross twice the curve.

**Solution:** Yes, you can't cross with a vertical line the graph twice.
::::
:::::

## Using the Horizontal Line Test

> ‚ÄúOnce we have determined that a graph defines a function, an easy way to determine if it is a one-to-one function is to use the horizontal line test. Draw horizontal lines through the graph. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph does not represent a one-to-one function.‚Äù ([Abramson, 2021, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/U57DQZPG)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/68C8JXSW?page=34&annotation=L9I5J3YA))

::: {.callout-important}
Given a graph of a function, use the horizontal line test to determine if the graph represents a one-to-one function.

1. Inspect the graph to see if any horizontal line drawn would intersect the curve more than once.
2. If there is any such line, determine that the function is not one-to-one.
:::

:::::{.my-example}
:::{.my-example-header}
**Example 15**
:::
::::{.my-example-container}
Consider the functions shown in @fig-01-12(a) and @fig-01-12(b). Are either of the functions one-to-one?

**Solution**: Only @fig-01-12(b) is a one-to-one function, because a horizontal line cannot cross the graph twice. @fig-01-12(a) is not a one-to-one function because a horizontal line would cross the curve three times.
::::
:::::

::: {.callout-warning}
The book answer is more detailed: There are places where a horizontal line would only cross once (for example at y = 4 or y = -4), places where it would cross twice (for example y = 3 or y = -3, here the horizontal line is a tangent and a crossing), but there also places (as I have mentioned in my solution) where the horizontal line intersects the graph three times (for instance y = 0).

The important thing is that it is not a one-to-one function if it could cross more than once.

It is also a good idea to compare the Precalculus exercises with the [Math topics of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/@GlaserTutoring/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=4) of The Glaser Tutorial Company. There are several hundreds of videos and it seems there is not only an overlap with Precalculus but their videos are following in detail the Precalculus content!

I thought that exercise 23 is not a function because of $\pm$, signifying that there are two output values. Actually I did not understand why exercise 23 is a function.

So I searched for a solution of the equation in the internet and found exactly my question asked at [math.stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4040159/when-x-pm-sqrty-1-is-y-a-function-of-x-how-to-deal-with-the-pm)!

After reading the question and both answers with all comments several times I believe I understood the problem: Central for my understanding was the start of the answer by [Rhys Hughes](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/487658/rhys-hughes) followed by his comment: 

$$
\begin{align*}
x = \pm y \\
x^2 = y^2 (\text{and not }\pm y^2 \text{ because ‚Ä¶} ) \\
x^2 = \pm (y^2) \\
x^2 = \pm(1)^2y^2 \\
x^2 = y^2
\end{align*}

I had no idea how to solve Exercise 33 (@eq-exercise-1-33) . Again I found the explication of the solution at [math.stackexchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3619578/given-gx-x2-2x-evaluate-frac-gx-gax-a).

Decisive for my understanding were three points:

1. I had only to substitute for $g(x)$ and $g(a)$. So the denominator $x-a$ remains $x-a$.
2. The substitute for $g(a)$ is equivalent to the substitute for $g(x)$. Instead of $g(x) = x^2 + 2x$ I have to use $g(a) = a^2 + 2a$.
3. The factorization with $(x-a)$, so that the denominator can be cancelled. I have to confess that I have limited knowledge of [polynomial factorization](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialFactorization.html).

I couldn't solve the second part of the exercise: Solve $f(x) = 4$. I searched on the internet and discovered [Mathepower](https://www.mathepower.com/en/index.php), a program for solving equation. I entered my problem and got the following correct answer with a detailed explanation of every step of calculation.

My problem: I do not know how to complete the square.

To generate a solution I could have used also [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).

I got the impression that I need to refresh my knowledge about factoring `r glossary("polynomials")` and solving of quadratic equations. So I registered with the Khan Academy and finished Unit 13 [Quadratics:Multiplying & Factoring](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratics-multiplying-factoring) of Algebra 1.

At first I thought I would need also need Unit 14  [Quadratic functions & equation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:quadratic-functions-equations), but after some exercises I got the impression that these skills already overlap with the tutorials of the Precalculus book, so I stopped my excursion for the time being.

::: {.callout-warning}
Ok, so with that refreshed knowledge I understand now better the factoring solution of Exercise 33 (@eq-exercise-1-33) and solving strategy of Exercise 37 (@eq-exercise-1-37). But still it was not everything completely clear to me.

**1. Given the function $g(x) = x^2 + 2x$, evaluate $\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}, x \ne a$**

In @eq-exercise-1-33 I understood that I need to factor out the denominator $x-a$. But whenever I tried it I got a slightly different result $x+a+4$ instead of $x+a+2$. Looking again in the internet I noticed that there is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdQj-YWHFhg) by [The Glaser Tutoring Company](https://www.youtube.com/@GlaserTutoring) exactly to the same problem: Evaluate the Given Function: $g(x) = x2 + 2x$!!

It turned out that I factored out wrongly:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a} = \frac{(x^2 + 2x) - (a^2 + 2a)}{x-a}\\
= \frac{x(x+2)-(a)(a+2)}{x-a} \\
= (x+2)-(a+2) \text{ Cancelation of } x-a \text{ is WRONG!}\\ 
= x-a+4
\end{align*}
$$

The correct way is:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a} = \frac{(x^2 + 2x) - (a^2 + 2a)}{x-a} \\
= \frac{x^2 + 2x - a^2 - 2a}{x-a} \\
= \frac{x^2 - a^2 + 2x - 2a}{x-a} \text{ regrouping the nominator!} \\
= \frac{(x+a)(x-a) + (2x - 2a)}{x-a}  \text{ a term of the form } (a^2-b^2) \text{ is always} (a+b)(a-b)! \\
= \frac{(x+a)(x-a) +2(x - a)}{x-a} \text{ factor out 2 in the second term}\\
\text{ only now it is save to cancel } (x-a)!\\
= (x+a)+2 \text{ = solution!}
\end{align*}
$$

**2. Given the function $f(x) = x^2 - 3x$ solve for $f(x) = 4$**

Concerning @eq-exercise-1-37 I learned that I have to set quadratic equations to 0. But I didn't understand why MathePower completed the square by adding $-(\frac{3}{2})^2$. Finally I solved this exercise again with the help of a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MOD3OoP2nI) by [The Glaser Tutoring Company](https://www.youtube.com/@GlaserTutoring). 

I knew that I could factor out the equation $0 = x^2 - 3x - 4$ with +1 and -4 but then I forgot that each product has to be set to zero. (Even I learned this one day before!). So - instead of not using the more complex solution with $-(\frac{3}{2})^2$ - I got:

$$
\begin{align*}
x^2 - 3x = 4\\
x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0 \\
(x - 4)(x + 1) = 0 \text{ now: set each term to zero} \\
x - 4 = 0; x = 4 \\
x + 1 = 0; x = -1 \\
\text{The solution set is } \{4; -1\}
\end{align*}
